Parameter definitions for pyoperant's json file

__Logging variables (variables that appear in the log file but do not affect code)__
    Machine: [str] user-defined machine name
    subject: [str] subject ID or name
    name: [str] experiment name
    description: [str] brief description of experiment
    comments: "json doesn't support comments"
    experimenter: [obj] experimenter details
        email: [str] experimenter's email address. Used if log_handlers is set to email
        name: [str] experimenter name

__Regular variables__
    shape: [bool] enable/disable shaping process
    classes: [obj] Defines stimulus classes (pyoperant currently only supports two classes *6/14/18 AR - Noted in behavior file, but not sure why it's true, and the three_ac_matching_config.json file has three entries here)
        (class Name): member, [obj] variable name is user-defined
            component: [str] component (as defined in local file) related to stimulus class, should be unique (multiple classes assigned to the same component will overwrite each other and not register correctly)
            punish_value: [num] value passed to punish subroutine when subject is punished for this stimulus class
            reward_value: [num] value passed to reward subroutine when subject responds correctly to this stimulus class
    intertrial_min: [num] minimum intertrial interval (in s)
    light_schedule: [str] array. paired values that define when lights should turn on and off (count of values should even). Times should be formatted as HH:MM
    panel_name: [str] which panel to use (as defined in local file)
    sr: [num] sample rate of playback in Hz
    session_schedule: [str] array. elements are times (in HH:MM format) to start and stop trials (and should be in pairs)
    session_days: [num]/[str] array. elements are days of the week to run trials. Elements can be either integers (Monday = 1, Tuesday = 2, etc.), strings of full day names, or strings of the three-letter abbreviations. Case insensitive.
    response_delay: [num] time in seconds to wait between start of stimulus playback and allowing a response
    response_win: [num] time in seconds, starting with stimulus onset, that subject has to respond to stimulus
    stims: [obj] members are pairs of values and stimulus file names (e.g., "1": "test1i_long.wav"), should list every stimulus in folder (even if not actually used) because interface file works much simpler that way
    correction_trials: [bool] enable/disable correction trials on incorrect response
    block_design: [obj] Defines stimulus blocks for experiment - default should be defined in behavior file
        order: [str] array. Order of blocks specified in block_design
        blocks: [obj] individual blocks
            (block Name): [obj] defines individual block parameters
                queue: [str] queue type, as defined in behavior file (which calls queues.py)
                conditions: object array. defines conditions within block - each stimulus must have its own element
                    class: [str] class name, as defined in "classes"
                    stim_name: [str] stimulus file value, as defined in "stims"
                weights: [obj] dictionary of class names and trial ratios
                    class: [str] class name, as defined in "classes"
                    weight: [int] weight of that class. Must be positive integer (not a fraction or probability)
                reinforcement: [obj] defines reinforcement-related parameters for block
                    schedule: [str] reinforcement schedule to use. Options are: variable_ratio, fixed_ratio, percent_reinf (default is continuous reinforcement)
                    secondary: [bool] enable/disable delivery of secondary reinforcement, if implemented
                    prob (opt): [num] value between 0 and 1 that defines the percent of time that a correect trial is rewarded (Used with PercentReinforcement)
                    ratio (opt): [num] value that defines reinforcement ratio (1=every trial, 2=every 2nd trial) (Used with VariableRatioSchedule, FixedRatioSchedule)
    debug: [bool] enable/disable debug logging


__Paths__
    experiment_path: [str] full path to experiment folder for writing log files
    stim_path: [str] full path to folder with stimuli files

__Unknown/unsure__
    criterion_correct_num: [num] ?
    criterion_correct_percent: [num] ?
    forced_choice: [bool] enables/disables forced choice (?)
    inject_test: [bool] ?
    current_scale: [num] ?
    distribution_type: [str] Chooses distribution to pull stimuli from?
    simple_trials_p: [num] ?
    log_handlers: [obj] SMTP config details if log files will be emailed to experimenter (?)
    category_conditions: object array. defines conditions within block - each stimulus must have its own element **NOTE: Not referenced anywhere except the json file and this guide, removed from JSON
        class: [str] class name, as defined in "classes"
        stim_name: [str] stimulus file value, as defined in "stims"
